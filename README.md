# Orchestra

Orchestra is a high-level, functional, and strongly-typed data coordination language for composing service interactions as a workflow application. It relies on a specialised compiler to produce highly scalable, distributed form of the workflow application by partitioning the workflow logic into smaller computational fragments that can be distributed across the network, and may be executed at different sites using a decentralised orchestration system.

Source code of the generative compiler and related documentation will soon be uploaded here
